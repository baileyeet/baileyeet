### Hi there 👋
## I'm Machiko (真知子) and welcome to my Github!

About me:
- 😄 I am a senior at Bryn Mawr College majoring in Computer Science
- 😄 I am also a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Computer and Information Science
- 🌱 I am currently doing machine translation at the Miyao research group of the University of Tokyo
    - Check out what we do [here](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index)!
- 🌱 I am a Spring 2024 TA for CIS4120 (Human Computer Interaction) at Penn :)
- 👀 I am interested in machine learning, specifically computer vision and natural language processing, and have previously interned thrice at NVIDIA under the DeepStream team, where I worked on multi-object tracking algorithms and low level optimization
- Most of the work I do does not use Github, so unfortunately, my profile may look a little less green than some others :((( 
- 💬 Feel free to reach out about anything related to machine learning or systems!
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileyhirota/) or at bhirota@seas.upenn.edu
