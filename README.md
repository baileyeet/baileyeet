### Hi there 👋
## I'm Machiko (真知子)/Bailey  and welcome to my Github!

About me:
- 😄 I graduated from Bryn Mawr College and majored in Computer Science
- 😄 I am also a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Computer and Information Science
- 🌱 I am currently a research intern at Tokyo-based unicorn Reazon Holdings, where I conduct ASR research
    - We recently released a [new version](https://research.reazon.jp/blog/2024-08-01-ReazonSpeech.html) of ReazonSpeech, the most accurate Japanese ASR model to date! 
- 👀 I am interested in machine learning, specifically computer vision and natural language processing, and have previously interned thrice at NVIDIA under the DeepStream team, where I worked on multi-object tracking algorithms and low level optimization. I also conducted machine translation research at the Miyao research [group](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index) of the University of Tokyo
- I previously TAed for Penn's CIS4120/520 course (Human Computer Interaction)
- Most of the work I do does not use Github, so unfortunately, my profile may look a little less green than some others :((( 
- 💬 Feel free to reach out about anything related to machine learning or systems!
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileyhirota/) or at bhirota@seas.upenn.edu
