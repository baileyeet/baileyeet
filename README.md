### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Bailey (Machiko)  and welcome to my Github!

About me:
- ðŸ˜„ I graduated from Bryn Mawr College and majored in Computer Science and am currently a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania as part of an Accelerated Masters program (BA+MS).
- ðŸŒ± I conduct NLP research at at Tokyo-based unicorn Reazon Holdings and Penn's [Computational Social Listening Lab](https://csl-lab-upenn.github.io/) 
    - At Reazon, we recently released a [new version](https://research.reazon.jp/blog/2024-08-01-ReazonSpeech.html) of ReazonSpeech, the most accurate Japanese ASR model to date!
    - At Penn, we're using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods to uncover insights about social norms across cultures
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in machine learning, specifically computer vision and natural language processing, and previously interned at NVIDIA under the DeepStream team, where I worked on multi-object tracking algorithms and low level optimization. I also conducted machine translation research at the Miyao research [group](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index) of the University of Tokyo, where I focused on the robustness of Japanese-English MT.
