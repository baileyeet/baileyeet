About me:
- I'm researching natural language processing and computational linguistics, particularly Japanese language, multilingual and code-switching ASR and multimodal models and machine translation at Tokyo-based Reazon Human Interaction Lab
    - We most recently released a [new version](https://research.reazon.jp/blog/2024-08-01-ReazonSpeech.html) of ReazonSpeech, one of the most accurate Japanese ASR models to date
    - We try to open source most, if not all, of our work
    - We're also working on a fully open-source humanoid robot arm, called [OpenArm](https://open-arm.org/).
- I'm a part of the Computational Social Listening Lab at Penn, where I'm work in computational social science and NLP
    - My current project is about using NLP methods to uncover insights about social norms across cultures
- I am interested in machine learning, specifically computer vision and natural language processing, and previously interned at NVIDIA under the DeepStream team, where I worked on multi-object tracking algorithms and low level optimization. I also conducted machine translation research at the Miyao research [group](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index) of the University of Tokyo, where I researched the effect of Japanese case markers on the robustness of Japanese-English MT.
